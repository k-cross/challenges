# Coding Challenge

Write a function that takes two parameters:

1. a String representing the contents of a text document
2. an integer providing the number of items to return

    Implement the function such that it returns a list of Strings ordered by word frequency, the most frequently occurring word first. 
    Use your best judgement to decide how words are separated. 
    Implement this function as you would for a production / commercial system 
    You may use any standard data structures. 
    Please use your choice of language.

## Performance Constraints:

    Your solution should run in O(n) time where n is the number of characters in the document. 
    Please provide reasoning on how the solution obeys the O(n) constraint.
